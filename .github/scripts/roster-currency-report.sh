# set, and a comment — the only form of delivery that actually notifies — is

This body is replaced by each run and states only the **current** verdict.
The history is in the comments below: one is posted whenever the verdict or
the set of drifting repositories changes. A run that changes nothing is
silent by design — see \`swift-institute/.github#65\`.
