    /// swift-linter is a third-party tool published by
    /// `swift-foundations/swift-linter`. Institute owns only the
    /// installation boundary, the invocation, and the measurement
    /// discipline around it — never the rules, the severities, or the
    /// exit policy, all of which come from the same binaries and the
    /// same consumer `Lint.swift` that CI consumes.
    ///
    /// ## Why parity is mechanical rather than aspirational
    ///
    /// CI installs the dispatcher and the prebuilt standard runner from
    /// the rolling `ci-binaries` release, verifies them against that
    /// release's `SHA256SUMS`, and invokes
    /// `swift-linter <package-root> --exit-policy strict` with
    /// `SWIFT_LINTER_RUNNER` pointing at the runner. This type does the
    /// same three things with the platform-matched assets from the same
    /// release. The release publishes a **composite digest** over the
    /// engine and rule-pack revisions it was built from, identical
    /// across platforms; that digest is the parity token, and
    /// ``Institute/Lint/divergence()`` compares the installed one
    /// against the one CI consumes.
    ///
    /// ## Why a run can never report clean without measuring
    ///
    /// The engine ships rule-pack-agnostic: without a reachable
    /// configuration, zero rules fire. Three invocations of the
    /// dispatcher produce exit zero with no output whatsoever — a
    /// directory holding Swift source but no `Lint.swift`, a *file* path
    /// rather than a package root, and an empty directory. Exit status
    /// therefore attests that a process ran, never that it was
    /// configured.
    ///
    /// The first of those three is why a package with no `Lint.swift` is
    /// not sent to the dispatcher at all but to the prebuilt runner with
    /// an explicit ``Institute/Lint/Bundle`` — see
    /// ``Institute/Lint/measure(_:using:default:)``. The other two remain
    /// silent zeros, and remain caught below.
    ///
    /// The engine's own always-on summary line is the positive control,
    /// and it is the only one available. Every run through this type is
    /// adjudicated by ``Institute/Lint/Summary`` and reports
    /// ``Institute/Lint/Measurement/Verdict/unmeasured(reason:)``

    /// count and a non-zero linted-file count.
