    /// ## Why a default exists at all
    ///
    /// The engine ships rule-pack-agnostic: with no reachable
    /// configuration it loads zero rules and exits clean having measured
    /// nothing. Institute previously refused such a package outright —
    /// `Lint.swift` decided whether a package was linted, and a
    /// checked-in allowlist recorded the packages excused from carrying
    /// one. That made the absence of a configuration the one way to be
    /// invisible to the linter.
    ///
    /// A default removes the exemption. It is not, however, a second
    /// standard: every case here is a bundle the prebuilt standard
    /// runner already bakes, chosen because it is **byte-for-byte the
    /// bundle the package's configured peers in the same layer
    /// activate**. So a package that adopts a `Lint.swift` tomorrow,
    /// written to the convention its layer already follows, is measured
    /// against exactly what it was measured against today. The default
    /// cannot be argued with as "the wrong rules", and it cannot be
    /// escaped by staying unconfigured.
    ///
    /// The three bundles are one lattice anchored on `institute`:
    /// `universal ⊂ institute ⊂ primitives`, and `standards` is
    /// `institute` minus two naming rules. Picking the layer's own
    /// bundle rather than one global choice is what keeps a
    /// primitives-layer package from being measured against a *weaker*
    /// set than its peers — which would reward staying unconfigured, the
    /// opposite of the point.
    ///
    /// ## This has no CI counterpart
    ///
    /// Everywhere else the lint capability runs exactly what CI runs.
    /// Here it cannot: CI's activation signal *is* the presence of
    /// `Lint.swift`, so for these packages CI runs nothing at all. A

    /// reported as one. Nothing in this type changes what the gating CI
