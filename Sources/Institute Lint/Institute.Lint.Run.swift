    /// or found no files, is `unmeasured` here exactly as it would be

    ///   with. `nil` means the caller could not determine one, and the

    ///
    /// - Parameter fix: When non-`nil`, the run applies (or previews) the
    ///   canonical fixes rewriter-backed rules declare instead of reporting
    ///   findings. The engine reads the mode from its own environment
    ///   channel; ``Institute/Lint/supportsFix(_:)`` is what keeps an older
    ///   installation — which ignores that channel and would lint silently
    ///   instead — from being handed the request at all.
