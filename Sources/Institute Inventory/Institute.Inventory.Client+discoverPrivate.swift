    /// **No `vacant` guard.** `discover(_:)` treats an empty *public* listing
    /// as a failed measurement, because every non-vacant policy organization
    /// is independently known to publish at least one public repository —
    /// an empty page is evidence of a broken read, not of an empty
    /// organization. No such independent fact holds for private listings:
    /// several policy organizations legitimately hold zero private
    /// repositories today, and nothing declares which. An empty private page
    /// is therefore read as zero, not as failure — the one deliberate
    /// asymmetry with the public path, and it is why this is a separate
    /// method rather than a visibility parameter on `discover(_:)`.
    ///
    /// **Records failure instead of aborting on it.** `discover(_:)` throws
    /// the instant one organization's listing or one repository's content
    /// read fails, because it feeds the committed file and a partial read
    /// must never publish as if it were complete. This method feeds no
    /// committed file. An organization whose listing fails becomes
    /// ``Institute/Inventory/Private/Unmeasured/Scope/organization(_:)``; a
    /// repository whose content read fails becomes
    /// ``Institute/Inventory/Private/Unmeasured/Scope/repository(_:)``; the
    /// pass continues with every other organization and repository rather
    /// than discarding their evidence too. `Task` cancellation is the one
    /// failure this still propagates immediately — it is not evidence about
    /// any repository, and swallowing it would hang the caller instead of
    /// stopping cooperatively.
