    /// **Why this exists: credential-holding and digesting are different
    /// jobs.** ``Client/discoverPrivate(_:)`` walks every Institute
    /// organization through *one* `gh` credential. No such credential
    /// exists in the control plane that needs the digest: a GitHub App
    /// mints installation tokens per organization, which is why the
    /// private-verification sweep already mints one token per org inside
    /// its own enumeration and holds the effective private roster in hand
    /// — while having no way to hand that roster to the digest. The result
    /// was a control plane dispatching the literal string `"unmeasured"`
    /// as its effective-inventory digest.
    ///
    /// This type is the seam: the caller supplies the population it is
    /// credentialed to see, and this module supplies the digest.
    ///
    /// **It carries coordinates and nothing else, deliberately.** Every
    /// other fact the digested population needs is derived here, exactly
    /// as ``Client/discoverPrivate(_:)`` derives it: the repository's
    /// fields from its coordinate, and its layer from the *organization's*
    /// layer in ``Institute/Inventory/Policy`` — never from anything the
    /// caller asserts. A caller therefore cannot spell a URL differently,
    /// or label a repository with a layer its organization does not carry,
    /// and silently change the digest. A digest computed from a roster is
    /// comparable, byte for byte, with one computed from a live pass over
    /// the same population, because the only thing the roster contributes
    /// is *which repositories were seen*.
    ///
    /// The roster also carries the caller's own UNMEASURED residue, in the
    /// same ``Output/Unmeasured`` rows the report publishes: an
    /// organization the caller's tokens could not list is recorded, not
    /// dropped, so an incomplete roster cannot pass itself off as a
    /// complete population.
