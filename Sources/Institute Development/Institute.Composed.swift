    /// The pure-SwiftPM composed-root build path — Phase 2 of the
    /// ecosystem coherence instrument (``Coherence``, issue #81).

    /// ``Xcode/Build`` merges the selection into one `xcodebuild` graph,
    /// which forces macOS. Per the standing cross-platform mandate
    /// (macOS-only tooling is a blocker), this is the mandate-required
    /// end state: a synthetic root package generated from the selected
    /// manifests — its `.package(path:)` dependencies spanning every
    /// selected repository that declares a library product — built with
    /// `swift build` through ``Build/Coordinator``. No Xcode, no
    /// workspace bundle, so it runs identically on Ubuntu.
    ///
    /// This is the shape the historical BUILD-AND-GRAPH-FINDINGS record's umbrella-root
    /// experiment documents, grown into a supported capability: generated
    /// fresh from the current selection immediately before every build
    /// (never a persisted artifact a later run could find stale), and
    /// sharing the coherence receipt's population-control contract with
    /// ``Xcode/Scheme`` — so a receipt from either build path is directly
    /// comparable.
    ///
    /// - Important: Only a *library* product can be named in another
    ///   target's `dependencies:` — SwiftPM does not allow a regular
    ///   target to depend on an executable or plugin product. A
    ///   repository whose manifest declares no library product
    ///   therefore has no way into the composed graph through this
    ///   mechanism, and its targets are excluded from
    ///   ``Composed/Root/expectedTargetCount(in:)`` accordingly — an
    ///   explicitly scoped limitation of product-dependency composition
    ///   itself, not a silently absorbed one. Every Institute package is
    ///   a library today, so this excludes nothing in practice; a future
    ///   executable-only inventory entry would be visible in the
    ///   receipt as a smaller `expectedTargetCount` than the xcodebuild
    ///   path's, not as a silent gap.
    ///
    /// - Important: Package identity for a `.package(path:)` dependency
    ///   is resolved by SwiftPM from the dependency's own materialized
    ///   directory, not declared by this generator. Every selected
    ///   repository's directory is named for its inventory `name`
    ///   (``Layout``), so this generator addresses each repository's
    ///   products as `package: repository.name` — which matches SwiftPM's
    ///   own resolution for every repository in the inventory today. A
    ///   repository whose resolved identity ever diverges from its
    ///   directory name is a real `graph`-stage resolution failure,
    ///   reported honestly through the coherence receipt rather than
    ///   guessed around; de-risking that at full-roster scale is the
    ///   open question the composed-root issue itself names.
