    ///   before composition. This is the *declared source*. Once the manifest
    ///   is overwritten it is gone, and it must return **byte-identical**, so
    ///   the verbatim text is the one thing that has to be kept.
    /// - ``planned`` — the exact `.package(path: …)` clause written in its
    ///   place. This is Institute's own *planned source*. Keeping the verbatim
    ///   text SwiftPM was handed lets ``restore`` match it exactly and refuse
    ///   loudly if a developer hand-edited the composed clause, rather than
    ///   re-deriving a spelling that might silently diverge.
    ///
    /// Everything else — the resolved revision, the compiled tree, the pins —
    /// is re-read from SwiftPM's own state and is never stored here. Neither
    /// field carries a machine path: ``declared`` holds a URL, ``planned`` holds
