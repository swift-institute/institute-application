    /// seal. That was the correct principle applied to one instance of the
    /// class: `compileEvidence` on the build and test legs is captured the
    /// same way, from tools pointed at the same absolute path, and refuses
    /// the seal for the same reason the moment a subject actually emits a
    /// compiler diagnostic — observed as
    /// `seal-refusal:unsafe-content` on hosted runs 31143653197 and
    /// siblings, where the subject failed to compile and the receipt could
    /// therefore not be produced at all.
    ///
    /// Applying it once, to every leg, is what makes the rule a property
    /// of the receipt boundary rather than of whichever leg someone
    /// remembered. An absolute path that is *not* under the subject root
    /// still refuses the seal — this narrows what must be refused, it does
    /// not weaken the refusal.
