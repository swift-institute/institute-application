    /// artifact. `Run` performs or seals that substitute verification for
    /// one subject package and emits one canonical, content-addressed
    /// ``Receipt``; ``Check`` independently re-parses and re-digests a
    /// sealed receipt.

    /// status or check, never mints a credential, and never decides which
    /// private repositories are in scope — that is Task 2-02's trusted
    /// control-plane dispatcher (`swift-institute/.github`), which invokes
    /// `institute verification seal` at an exact recorded Institute

    /// observe (see ``Run``'s documentation for exactly which facts those
