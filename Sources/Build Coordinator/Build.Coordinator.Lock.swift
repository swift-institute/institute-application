    /// One key — `swiftpm-build-coordinator` — is the whole point. SwiftPM at
    /// a package root and `xcodebuild` over the generated workspace are
    /// different tools contending for the same machine: the shared manifest
    /// and repository caches, the toolchain's module cache, and the source
    /// trees themselves. A second key would be a second machine-wide
    /// invariant, and two of those do not compose — each would be correct
    /// about its own population and blind to the other's.
    ///
    /// The source trees are why this matters *more* for a workspace build
    /// than for a package build, not less. `swift build` compiles a package's
    /// dependencies from pinned remote checkouts under its own `.build`, so a
    /// concurrent edit elsewhere in the hierarchy cannot reach it. A workspace
    /// build compiles every selected package *from the working copy*, so any
    /// coordinated write anywhere in the selection is inside its blast radius.
    /// That has already happened once (issue #7): a whole-workspace build
    /// failed with `type 'Institute' has no member 'Lint'` because a
    /// concurrent session wrote those sources mid-build. Holding the lock
    /// across the compilation is what makes that unreachable through
    /// coordinated paths.
    ///
    /// Written as one operation both entry points call, rather than as a lock
    /// value each acquires for itself, because the ordering is the part that
    /// has to be identical: acquire, spawn, clean up generated state, release,
    /// and fold a lost release into the operation's own failure instead of
    /// replacing it. Two copies of that sequence would be two chances to drift
    /// in key, in mode, or in what happens on the failure path.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - invocation: The argument vector, run through `/usr/bin/env`.
    ///   - directory: The child's working directory.
    ///   - description: How the operation is named in failure messages.
    ///   - capture: When `true`, the child's `stdout`/`stderr` are piped and
    ///     returned in the result instead of inherited. Every existing entry
    ///     point defaults this to `false` and keeps streaming live to the
    ///     parent's own streams — the point of an interactive, potentially
    ///     multi-hour build. A caller that needs the first diagnostic's text
    ///     (mechanical failure attribution, not human progress) opts in
    ///     explicitly; see ``Build/Coordinator/run(_:fresh:arguments:capturingDiagnostics:)``.
    ///   - cleanup: Removes any state the caller generated for this run. Runs
    ///     after the child exits and before the lock is released, and on every
    ///     failure path including a failure to acquire. Returns the error to
    ///     report, having folded in anything its own removal hit.
