# Institute — agent instructions

The Swift Institute front door: the public package inventory, machine-checked facts about a
checkout, and an isolated local development checkout for Xcode. Read `README.md` first for
orientation. Nothing here needs Institute access. The one exception is explicit and opt-in:
`institute doctor --institute` asks for the roster-currency check and needs an authenticated
`gh`. No other step does — if one wants credentials or a repository you cannot read, that is a
defect worth reporting.

## Commands

All paths are relative to the repository root.

```sh
swift run institute sync --dry-run   # plan only, changes nothing
swift run institute sync             # clone and fast-forward
swift run institute build            # build the whole selection, one xcodebuild
swift run institute doctor           # report checkout facts
swift run institute doctor --institute  # + roster currency (needs gh)
.build/debug/institute package test --package-path . --fresh
.build/debug/institute navigation install
.build/debug/institute navigation check
.build/debug/institute source prepare --workspace-path <workspace.xcworkspace>
.build/debug/institute source measure --workspace-path <workspace.xcworkspace>
.build/debug/institute source repair plan --workspace-path <workspace.xcworkspace> --output-path <plan.json>
.build/debug/institute source repair apply --workspace-path <workspace.xcworkspace> --plan-path <plan.json>

# per-organization GitHub App installation token, for high-volume machine reads
GH_TOKEN=$(institute github token --org <org>) gh api rate_limit
institute github token --org <org> --permission contents=read   # narrowed

# local-source composition, for changing a package and its consumer together
swift run institute compose --consumer <c> --dependency <d>
swift run institute verify  --consumer <c> --dependency <d>
swift run institute restore --consumer <c> --dependency <d>
```

The first `swift run` in a fresh clone compiles the whole dependency graph and is **silent for
several minutes**. It is not hung. That invocation bootstraps the executable; after it exists,
run SwiftPM work only through `.build/debug/institute package`.

`doctor` reports which checks apply to your setup. A check that needs Institute access reports
that it did not run — that is not a failure of your checkout. `--institute` is the one opt-in
that asks for those checks; it is never selected from ambient machine state, so an
authenticated `gh` never changes what a plain `doctor` does.

## Gotchas

- **The materialized roots (`atoms/`, `swift-molecules/`, `swift-standards/`,
  `swift-compositions/`, …) hold independent repositories, not part of this one.** Each has its own history, remote,
  CI, and license. Work on a package inside its own repository and open the pull request there.
  The active layout resolves the checkout physically and places the roots beside it (see
  the generated Architecture Index, "Materialization layout"); invoking through a symlink does not redirect the
  hierarchy. The root names remain ignored here transitionally for checkouts that materialized
  inside the clone, and committing their contents to this repository is always wrong. Doctor
  reports legacy-only and duplicate legacy-plus-sibling materializations as errors, uses only
  the sibling for downstream checks, and never migrates or deletes the legacy contents.
- **`Institute.json` is the sole name → org → path authority.** A repository's location is
  derived from its inventory entry's `organization` and `layer` fields (authority, vendor, and
  jurisdiction orgs nest under their layer root, e.g. `swift-standards/swift-ietf/<package>`).
  Never infer a location from a package's name and never scan the tree for packages — resolve
  through the inventory (`Institute.Layout` in the application). Materialized paths are
  regenerable state; nothing durable may reference one as stable. Peer institutes follow the
  same discipline one level up: `Peers.json` registers each peer and the peer's own inventory
  file declares its packages, resolved at `<entry>/<peer>/<organization>/<name>`
  (`Institute.Peer.Layout`); adoption is opt-in per checkout, and an unmaterialized peer is a
  fact, not a finding.
- **`sync` never rewrites work.** It fast-forwards only a checkout that is clean, on `main`,
  tracking `origin/main`, with no local commits. It never resets, cleans, stashes, rebases, or
  switches a branch. Dirty worktrees and feature branches are reported and left alone. Preserve
  that guarantee in any change you make to it.
- **`Package.resolved` is generated state.** Never commit, hand-edit, or delete it to force
  resolution. Change `Package.swift` and resolve.
- **`institute.xcworkspace` is generated state; `Selection.json` is its authored input.**
  `sync` renders the workspace from the resolved selection and byte-compares before writing,
  so it is deterministic in the same sense `Institute.json` is. It is ignored and must never
  be committed — a tracked derived file can disagree with its source, and it did: the
  version tracked until 2026-07-28 rendered a five-entry selection while the working copy
  carried 437, and nothing reported the divergence because agreement was never checked
  against the *committed* pair. Change the selection and run `sync`; never hand-edit the
  workspace or add references in Xcode. `Selection.json` is committed policy input — the
  public default checkout, the whole roster since c850ed5 — so it is the one of the two
  that stays tracked.
- **`Selection.json` is policy; `Selection.local.json` is one machine's choice.** They used to
  be the same file, which meant every local expansion showed up as a pending policy change,
  was one `git add .` from becoming one, and left the file perpetually dirty. On 2026-07-28
  that became a live hazard: concurrent sessions had to be told individually not to commit,
  checkout, stash or clean it. To change what *your* checkout opens, write the ignored
  `Selection.local.json` — `{"version": 1, "add": [...], "remove": [...]}`, both keys
  required — and never edit `Selection.json` for that purpose. Three properties are
  load-bearing and must survive any change here. It is a **delta**, not a replacement, so a
  package added to policy later still arrives rather than being silently frozen out.
  Validation applies to the **merged** result — `Selection.effective(at:in:)` is the only
  path to a selection, and an override that is present but malformed fails the command
  instead of falling back to committed policy. And `sync` and `doctor` both **lead with
  which selection is in effect**, naming every identity the local file withholds, because a
  silent override is worse than the shared artifact it replaced. That line is a report
  header rather than a `doctor` check on purpose: a check can report `notApplicable`, and a
  check that never ran must never look like one that passed (issue #43). See
  [DESIGN-Selection-Override-2026-07-29](https://github.com/swift-institute/Research/blob/main/institute-application-historical/Local%20Resolution/DESIGN-Selection-Override-2026-07-29.md) and issue #46.
- **`institute build` builds the selection in one `xcodebuild`; `institute package build` builds
  one package in one `swift build`. They are not the same measurement.** The package path
  resolves dependencies from *pinned remotes*, so it cannot see a local edit at all — change a
  selected package and a consumer's `swift build` compiles the published version and reports
  success. The workspace path resolves members from local paths, so it is the only one that
  builds the institute from the working copy. It is also the only one that shares work: the
  serialised path gives each package its own `.build` and recompiles the shared closure once per
  package, while one merged graph compiles it once.
- **A stale `Institute.xcscheme` does not fail the build — it silently builds less of the
  selection.** `xcodebuild` drops a `BuildableReference` whose blueprint matches no target in its
  container *without a warning*: measured, one fabricated entry among valid ones still exits 0 and
  prints `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`, and only an entirely unmatched scheme fails (exit 66). Nothing
  in the build output can catch it either, because an up-to-date target compiles nothing, so "not
  in the log" and "not in the scheme" are the same observation. This is why the scheme is
  generated from `swift package dump-package` rather than from target names anyone typed, and why
  `institute build` re-renders it from the manifests and byte-compares *before* building, refusing
  to run on a mismatch. Never hand-edit the scheme, and never soften that pre-flight check into a
  warning — a build path that can report success having compiled a fraction of the selection is
  the exact failure this gate exists to prevent.
- **`github token` mints a credential, so it prints one thing and logs nothing.** The token is
  the whole of stdout, with no trailing commentary, so `GH_TOKEN=$(institute github token --org
  X)` captures a credential and nothing else; whether it was minted or served from cache goes to
  stderr. It needs a GitHub App private key the operator installed themselves under
  `~/.config/swift-institute-bot/`, alongside a file naming the application identity — neither
  the identity nor the key location is compiled in, and no diagnostic names the resolved key
  path, because that path identifies a machine and the key is fleet-password-equivalent. Tokens
  are cached mode-600 per organization *and per permission set*: a token narrowed to
  `contents=read` and one carrying the installation's full grant are different credentials, and
  a shared cache entry would silently widen the first. Preserve both properties in any change
  here — a mint path that can print a token into a log, or hand back a wider credential than was
  asked for, is the failure this capability exists to avoid. The point of it is rate pools: each
  installation carries its own, so high-volume machine reads under an installation token do not
  spend the principal's single shared one. Judgment writes stay on the principal identity, and a
  read that guards a mutation uses the same identity as the mutation.
- **Roster drift is detected by CI, not by anyone remembering.** `inventory-currency`
  compares `Institute.json` against a live discovery in both directions. It needs an
  authenticated `gh`, so no contributor command reaches it and none should: `doctor` is
  credential-free and offline, and selecting Institute access from ambient state would make
  a green `doctor` mean different things on different machines — including for every
  contributor who authenticated `gh` to run `gh issue list`, as this file tells them to.
  `--institute` is the explicit ask; the nightly `roster-currency` workflow is what removes
  the human. That workflow fails rather than reporting clean when the check says `not run`,
  because a check that did not execute must never read like one that found nothing — the
  defect that kept this check unreachable for its whole life (issue #43).
- **The `swift` and `xcode` fields in `Institute.json` are a floor, not a pin, and the README
  documents that same floor.** They were a pin compared by string containment, which meant a
  toolchain *newer* than the declared one failed. No single number could be green on both the
  maintainer machine and a contributor following the README, so the two drifted apart and
  `contributor-path.yml` sat red: the README named Swift 6.3.3 / Xcode 26.6 while
  `Institute.json` declared 6.4 / 27.0, and a contributor who installed exactly what they were
  told got exit 1 (issue #57). Do not restore containment, and do not raise the floor to a
  toolchain that is only available as a beta or a preview runner image — a floor nobody can
  meet turns every green tick red for a reason unrelated to the change under test. Raise it
  when the toolchain is installable without a preview, and move the README in the same commit.
- **Dependencies are branch-based.** `doctor` warns when a recorded pin lags its branch tip;
  a green over stale pins is not evidence — re-resolve.
- **A source verdict of "clean" always means something was measured.** swift-linter
  ships rule-pack-agnostic: without a reachable configuration zero rules fire, and a
  directory with no `Lint.swift`, a *file* path, or an empty directory each exit zero
  having printed nothing. Exit status attests that a process ran, never that it was
  configured. Source measurement adjudicates every run against the engine's always-on summary
  line and reports `UNMEASURED` — never clean — when the line is absent, no rules
  loaded, or no files were scanned, per package inside the cohort as well as alone.
  Preserve that in any change: a source path that can report clean without a summary
  line is the defect this capability exists to prevent. Cohort measurement likewise fails
  rather than reporting an empty ecosystem clean when the inventory materializes
  nothing, which is what a run from the wrong hierarchy root looks like.
- **There is no opt-out from source measurement.** Every admitted package receives the
  exact profile for its classified layer. Do not introduce an allowlist, skip list, or other
  record that excuses a package from measurement. A package that cannot be classified or
  measured is `UNMEASURED`, never clean or defaulted to a guessed profile.
- **swift-linter is developer tooling, not an inventory package.** Prepare it through
  `institute source prepare`; never add it to `Institute.json` and never put a machine
  path in durable configuration. The source profile and preparation receipt bind the exact
  executable, tool digest, configuration, and environment; a measurement run is offline.
  Do not add a flag that softens the rule set, severities, or fail-closed interpretation.
- **cclsp is developer tooling, not an inventory package.** Install and verify it through
  `institute navigation`; never add it to `Institute.json`, resolve it from a personal fork,
  or put a fixed machine checkout path in durable configuration. `navigation serve` owns the
  Xcode/`TOOLCHAINS` boundary. The merged cross-package index remainder is institute-application#25.
- **The generated Xcode workspace uses relative references only.** Never emit an absolute path
  into `institute.xcworkspace` or into `Institute.json` — the package root is the checkout
  itself and is emitted as `group:.`, while materialized packages use
  `group:../<inventory-derived-reference>`.
- **A composed manifest is uncommittable local state.** `compose` writes a machine-local
  absolute path deliberately: off-machine it must fail loudly at resolution rather than silently
  resolve elsewhere. Never commit one; `restore` before pushing. `restore` returns the declared
  clause byte-for-byte and never touches the dependency's worktree.
- **`restore`'s structural check is not a reproducibility guarantee.** It evaluates the restored
  manifest in isolation and confirms three things: it evaluates, the dependency is declared by
  URL again, and no local path leaked. It resolves nothing and contacts no remote. Report its
  scope honestly — a green structural check does not mean the consumer builds from canonical
  sources, and unpushed dependency commits will only surface in a real resolve.

Open work lives in GitHub issues:

```sh

```

Changes are pull requests. Before opening one: `doctor` reports no errors, the package passes a
fresh coordinator test from its own repository, and new behaviour is covered by a test. New
capability comes with the acceptance criteria that prove it — a check whose failure mode is a
clean-looking pass is not finished.
